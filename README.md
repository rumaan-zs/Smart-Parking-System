# Smart-Parking-System
A smart parking system that checks for parking and allocates location for parking.
This project is developed using MatLab and uses image processing.
Computerized systems being an integral part of the current era, an automated parking system is one of its most commonly used applications. The aim of this model is to build up and implement an automatic parking system that will detect the parking space with the help of image processing techniques. The smart parking system will be able to have fewer interactions with humans for simple tasks. In addition to that, it has a parking guidance system that can demonstrate and guide users towards a parking space. With the problems of ever increasing urban traffic congestion and the ever increasing shortage of space, the parking lots need to be well-equipped with parking space detection. The proposed system helps in counting the number of parked vehicles and identifying the number of spots available. A camera is installed at a high and fixed position in the parking lot. An image of an empty parking lot is taken as reference and then an image of a parking lot with cars is taken. Both the images are subtracted to find the numbers of parking slots available.
When talking about the metropolitan cities, traffic jams have become quite common recently due to the large number of vehicles. Also, we cannot deny the existence of cars in our daily life. Whenever we go out by car, we face problems finding an available parking space. When a driver enters a certain parking lot, the first thing that he does is to look for some sign which tells whether the parking lot is fully occupied, partly occupied or vacant. . He also does not know how many parking slots are there and where to find a parking division for his car. Some of the parking divisions may remain unoccupied even when the total occupancy is high. This causes ineffective use of parking divisions as well as traffic jams around the entrance of parking lots. Therefore, by offering drivers with relevant information about the parking lot while entering the parking lot becomes an important issue. When a driver enters a certain parking lot, the driver takes a long time just to find an available parking space. Counting Available Parking Space using Image Processing helps to solve the problem that the driver faces at low cost. The system uses image processing to detect the existence of the car and also provides information such as the number of available parking spaces. The system captures images using CCTV cameras and processes the image to count the available parking space. The system basically is implemented to plan, analyze, design, development and testing. The development of this system will use techniques of image processing that will be implemented in each phase of the methodology. This system gives information about the number of available parking spaces. It will provide benefits to all the drivers when they enter the parking lot. The system uses image processing, since the whole area in the parking lot can be observed with relatively few cameras. Other than that, the system is compact and the cost is not high. The image of a parking lot is taken by a surveillance camera set at some height in the parking lot. MATLAB is used as a software platform in this project.
